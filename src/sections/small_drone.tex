\section{Small Drone}
\label{section:small_drone}

In an effort to avoid some of the logistical limitations induced by the larger drones,
e.g.~transportation, material costs in the case of crashes, maintenance, overhead from the creation of
component covers and mounts, and the use of large batteries,
I have adapted a drone design~\cite{raspberry_pi_drone_thingiverse_original} from Thingiverse.com for the purposes of autonomous landing.
The base design is a very simple quadcopter platform with
a large area for mounting electronics,
a flexible motor mount,
a symmetric arm design which allows all arms to be interchangeable with one another,
and
a simple press-fit system for attaching the arms to the body.
After modifications, it now includes a pitch-gimbal mount for a Raspberry Pi camera module that is controlled by a micro servo,
mounting holes for various components (including the Raspberry Pi, power distribution board, metal legs, and standoffs for an ``upper deck'').
All modifications were made with OpenSCAD and are available in the drone's github repository~\cite{rpi_drone_github_repo}
The drone runs on a 3S (11.1V) lithium polymer power system, with a DJI Snail propulsion system.
