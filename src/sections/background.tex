\section{Background}

\subsection{Autopilot Software/Hardware}

The most prominent, open source drone autopilot software packages are ArduPilot~\cite{ardupilot_website} and PX4~\cite{pixhawk_website},
which can integrate easily with many additional/custom software packages.
DJI drones, while the most commonly used consumer-grade drones, use proprietary, closed source autopilot software
that has a limited API for interacting with external software.
Thus, ArduPilot and PX4 and custom drones are typically used for research on drones themselves,
while DJI software and drones are typically used for consumer/commercial tasks.
ArduPilot and PX4 communicate using the same open source, customizable protocol - MAVLink~\cite{mavlink_io} -
which has APIs in many different programming languages as well as with \gls{ROS}.
