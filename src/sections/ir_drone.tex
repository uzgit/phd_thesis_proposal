\section{Infrared Camera, Heavy-Lift Drone}
\label{section:ir_drone}

Drone-based remote sensing is a new and powerful tool in many fields, including geology.
To this end, Geologist Christopher Hamilton brought a heavy lift drone to Iceland
with the plan of collecting infrared video at active lava sites.
The drone is theoretically capable of lifting itself with an extra load of 25 kg.
This high weight capacity is necessary to lift multiple large batteries,
a large gimbal,
and an infrared camera (FLIR).
