\section{Testing on Physical Hardware}

The first phase of this testing is to port the high-performing networks from testing in simulation to the real hardware.
So far, we are targeting our existing Google Coral Dev Board, which has an embedded TPU,
and an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, which has an embedded GPU.
We will implement the pre-/post-processing wrappers for rectification and command generation in the same way as in the testing in simulation,
and instantiate the trained networks on the embedded hardware.
