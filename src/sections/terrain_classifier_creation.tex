\section{Terrain Classifier Creation}

We will train, test, and evaluate multiple neural networks in their ability to predict the
``correct'' safety mask of the landing sites in the synthetic data sets.
We will focus first on using U-nets to map from the input LIDAR or RGBD image
to the output mask, as they have been proven to be good classifiers in many different scenarios,
from terrain analysis, to tissue analysis, to road identification, etc.
