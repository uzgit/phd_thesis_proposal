Here we outline the plan for using the knowledge and physical drone platforms generated
until now to create a method for landing in unstructured environments.
The critical difference is that we will avoid making major assumptions about the landing area,
e.g.~that it uses a specific type of fiducial marker.
The goal is to create a lightweight method for analyzing terrain in real time,
identifying safe landing sites,
and navigating to those landing sites without using some exterior information such as GPS.
